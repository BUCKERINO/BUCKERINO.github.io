                            <p>Doodle dream School invasion is a topdown shooter where you have to kill monsters in order to escape the school.
                                At the beginning of the game you get to choose which weapon you want to use to kill the monsters. In order to
                                progress you have to kill all the monsters in the room and shoot down the door to go to the next room. Once you've
                                found the room with the stairs you'll be able to go down a floor. You can find the exit of the school on the main floor
                                but be careful because there is terible monster gaurding it.

                                For the gun we wanted to be able to switch between multiple guns to add a bit of variety when killing the monsters. 
                                In order to get this working I made sure the guns were scriptable objects with a fire and reload function. This gave
                                me the ability to make a script where I could load in the gun and have easy acces to its functions.

                                We wanted more action in our game. So we thought it was a fun idea to shoot down the doors instead of opening a door.
                                For this to I made an array with all the rigidbody's of the door pieces and the gave the door some health. When a
                                bullet collides with the door the hp of the door goes down. When the hp is down to zero, a foreach loop will add a force, a direction
                                and a random torque to all the rigidbody's of the door pieces.

                                We had a problem where the enemies were able to immidiatly go towards the player when the game began. This was an issue because we dont want
                                enemy's to attack the player when the player is not in the same room as the enemy's. To fix this I made a room detection. This made sure that
                                the enemy's only started moving when the player was in the same room as the enemy's and it also turned on the lights to show that the room
                                got activated.
