													Doodle dream school invasion is a top-down shooter where you have to kill monsters in order to escape the school.
                                                    At the beginning of the game, you get to choose which weapon you want to use to kill the monsters. In order to
                                                    progress, you have to kill all the monsters in the room and shoot down the door to go to the next room. Once you've
                                                    found the room with the stairs, you'll be able to go down a floor. You can find the exit of the school on the main floor
                                                    but be careful because there is a terrible monster guarding it.

												For this project, my brother and I worked together to make Nekolow. This was interesting because he had no
                                                experience in game development whatsoever. But that didn't stop us. The game is inspired by a game called
                                                downwell. You play as a cat that wants to get to the bottom of the well where a delicious snack is waiting
                                                for it. During your fall, you encounter monsters that don't want you there and try to attack you. You kill
                                                them by shooting them or jumping on them.

                                                            To solve this issue, I put the menu buttons in an array. When left or right is pressed.

											Make me laugh is the first game jam I participated in.
                                            The theme was make me laugh. We were in a group of 8 
                                            people and we had two days to make a game. The game
                                            is inspired by a game by the name of shotgun roulette 
                                            where you play shotgun roulette with an eldritch monster.
                                            Your objective is to use various items to make sure the
                                            Eldritch monster shoots himself. We wanted to make something
                                            similar, where you had cards with jokes on them to make
                                            a funny joke.

                                                        scriptable objects of the cards that can hold the information
                                                        of the card. These cards are put into a list and card objects
                                                        get made for every scriptable object in the list. Once they were
                                                        created they were removed from the list.

                                                        is considered funny, 0 if the joke was not that funny but
                                                        not that bad either, and -1 if the joke was bad.

														We also needed some audio to set the mood. For this, I made 
                                                        an array of Sounds. These sounds had some values, you could
                                                        change. Then in the audio manager script new audio
                                                        source components are made from those values. Lastly the
                                                        audio manager had a public function called play, which took in
                                                        a string. If wanted to play a certain sound at some point
                                                        I can call up the instance of the audio manager and say
                                                        which sound needs to be played by typing the name of the sound.

											SteamSky is my first project where I worked together
                                            with another game developer and game artists. The game is a bullet hell side scroller game. 
                                            In this game, you have to dodge bullets from enemies that move towards you in unique patterns.
                                            Score as many points as possible and defeat the final boss at the end.

                                                        We wanted the waves of enemies to be fully customizable so that every wave looked unique.
                                                        So for every wave you can give it a name, add enemies to a list and per enemy you can
                                                        say what their movement is supposed to be. You can choose between move straight, move along
                                                        a sin wave or a custom path.

                                                        constant value that would move the y of the character down. When the player
                                                        jumps the y value gets increased over time and then decreases to simulate

								Hello, I am Tycho van de Wetering, a game developer specializing in gameplay
                                programming for Unity C#. As a second-year game development student, I have
                                been able to learn and explore various aspects of game development and I have
                                gained a good understanding in not only programming but also: how to organize
                                production and working with other game developers and game artists.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even though gameplay programming is my primary focus, I also learned some other
                                aspects of game development such as: scrum leader, level designer, UI maker and
                                integrator, audio editor and integrator and FSM designer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Please take a look around my portfolio, where you will be fascinated about my latest
                                projects that are showcasing what my skills and specialties are. You can reach out to
