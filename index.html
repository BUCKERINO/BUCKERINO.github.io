													Doodle dream school invasion is a top-down shooter where you have to kill monsters in order to escape the school.
                                                    At the beginning of the game, you get to choose which weapon you want to use to get out of the building. In order to
                                                    progress, you have to defeat all the monsters in the room and shoot down the doors to enter the next room. Once you've
                                                    the stairs, you'll be able to go down a floor. You can find the exit of the school on the main floor
                                                    but be careful because there is a terrible monster guarding it.

																We wanted more action in our game. So we thought it was a fun idea to shoot down the doors instead of opening them.
                                                                The problem was that the door had multiple pieces that had to fly away in order to make it look like it was getting blown up.
																To fix this problem, I made an array with all the rigid body's of the door pieces and then gave the door some health. When a
                                                                bullet collides with the door, the hit points of the door goes down. When the health of the door is down to zero, a foreach loop adds force, direction
                                                                and a random torque to all the rigidbody's of the door pieces to make it look like it is exploding.

																With another script I could then make a serialize field where I could fill in the gun based on what the weapon the player chooses.
                                                                In the same script I would then check for input from the player that would call the reload and shoot functions when the shoot or reload buttons were pressed.

											Make me laugh is the first game jam I participated in.
                                            The theme was make me laugh. We were in a group of eight 
                                            people and we had two days to make a game. The game
                                            is inspired by a game by the name of shotgun roulette 
                                            where you play shotgun roulette with an eldritch monster.
                                            Your objective is to use various items to make sure the
                                            Eldritch monster shoots himself. We wanted to make something
                                            similar, where you had cards with jokes on them to make
                                            a funny joke.

                                                        source components are made from those values. Lastly the
                                                        audio manager had a public function called play, which took in
                                                        a string. If wanted to play a certain sound at some point
                                                        I can call up the instance of the audio manager and say
                                                        which sound needs to be played by typing the name of the sound.

											SteamSky is my first project where I worked together
                                            with another game developer and game artists. The game is a bullet hell side scroller game. 
                                            In this game, you have to dodge bullets from enemies that move towards you in unique patterns.
                                            Score as many points as possible and defeat the final boss at the end.

														When we were discussing how we wanted to spawn enemies, we came to the conclusion that
                                                        We wanted the waves of enemies to be fully customizable so that every wave looked unique.
                                                        So for every wave you can give it a name, add enemies to a list and per enemy you can
                                                        say what their movement is supposed to be. You can choose between move straight, move along
                                                        a sin wave or a custom path.

                                                        For the left and right movement, I had a value that would increase when
                                                        moving right and decrease when moving left. For the y movement, I had a
                                                        constant value that would move the y of the character down. When the player
                                                        jumps the y value gets increased over time and then decreases to simulate
                                                        gravity.

								Hello, I am Tycho van de Wetering, a game developer specializing in gameplay
                                programming for Unity C#. As a second-year game development student, I have
                                been able to learn and explore various aspects of game development and I have
                                gained a good understanding in not only programming but also: how to organize
                                production and working with other game developers and game artists.
							</p>

							<p>
								Even though gameplay programming is my primary focus, I also learned some other
                                aspects of game development such as: scrum leader, level designer, UI maker and
                                integrator, audio editor and integrator and FSM designer.
							</p>

							<p>
								Please take a look around my portfolio, where you will be fascinated about my latest
                                projects that are showcasing what my skills and specialties are. You can reach out to
